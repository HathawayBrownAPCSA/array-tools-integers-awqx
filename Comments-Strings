Looks good at first ... but there are problems with all four of your Min/Max methods.
None of them return the right value in many circumstances.
getMax, for instance, returns the last item in the list that is bigger than the one before it.  So if your list was
  {"Xin", "Alison", "Harry"} it would return "Harry".
  
You may want to consider your comparison.  You are comparing to the previous item rather than the current maximum.

I think you will also find that your code is simpler when you fix this bug.  

7/10 right now; 9/10 when fixed.

**Alison here
Whoops, sorry. Forgot to push my finished code on Friday. 

Everything was fixed, then. You can probably check my Google Drive history. 

** Update Feb. 1
Yes, everything in this version is good to go too.  I didn't go back to the History - but good to know you had it.
Nicely cleaned up!
9/10 as promised.
And if, at the end of the semester, 1 point makes a difference in your grade ... remind me then.

Thanks!
